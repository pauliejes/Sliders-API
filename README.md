## Crowd Sourced data app for my CS50 iOS dev course

### Overview:
I am planning to use WiFi access point location data for an app I'm making for my iOS class.  The app I'm building for this project will show you coffee shop/cafe locations with open wi-fi hot spots and also allow the user to tie other manually gathered meta-data to these locations (eg. if the spot has a public-unlocked bathroom, or bathroom codes in the event they're locked. Maybe also free events happening at these locations). This will be an open sourced project and data for the app will also be mostly crowd sourced from the users.
